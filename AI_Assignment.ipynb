    "- The graph is an abstraction of the problem where each node represents a state or stage in the problem-solving process, and the edges represent the possible actions or steps to move from one state to another. The starting point (A) and the solution (S) are specific nodes in the graph, and the problem-solving process involves moving through the graph from A to S following the edges.\n",

    "- Clarity: Visualizations make complex relationships easier to understand.\n",
    "-  Problem-Solving: It can help in identifying the most efficient path or detecting if there are multiple solutions.\n",
    "-  Communication: Easier to communicate the structure of the problem to others.\n",

    "### (b)Dijkstra's algorithm:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by expanding a frontier of nodes that have been visited but not yet explored. At each step, the algorithm chooses the node in the frontier with the lowest cost and expands it. The algorithm terminates when the destination node is reached.\r\n",

    "- Step 1: Initialize the frontier with the start node (A).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Step 2: While the frontier is not empty:\r\n",
    "  - Choose the node in the frontier with the lowest cost.\r\n",
